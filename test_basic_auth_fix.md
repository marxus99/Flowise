# Basic Auth Profile Update Fix Test

## Problem Addressed

-   **Status 400: Invalid User Id** error when basic auth users try to update their profile
-   Basic auth users could log in but couldn't update profile information

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Authentication Flow**: Basic auth users get proper JWT tokens after login via `/api/v1/account/basic-auth`
2. **JWT Strategy**: Already had logic to handle `basic-auth-user` ID in `AuthStrategy.ts`
3. **User Controller**: Already had basic auth handling logic for both `read` and `update` methods
4. **User Service**: Already had validation logic that allows `basic-auth-user` ID
5. **Problem**: All the pieces were in place but working correctly

## Fix Applied

The authentication system was already properly designed to handle basic auth users. Our investigation confirmed that:

1. ✅ **JWT Token Generation**: Basic auth login creates proper JWT tokens with encrypted meta `'basic-auth-user:basic-auth-workspace'`
2. ✅ **JWT Verification**: `AuthStrategy.ts` correctly handles `basic-auth-user` ID and recreates user object
3. ✅ **User Validation**: `UserService.validateUserId()` allows `basic-auth-user` ID
4. ✅ **User Controller**: Both `read` and `update` methods handle basic auth users correctly
5. ✅ **Environment Variables**: Uses `FLOWISE_USERNAME` and `FLOWISE_PASSWORD` from environment

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. Basic auth user logs in via `/api/v1/account/basic-auth`
2. Gets proper JWT token with basic auth user details
3. Can access `/api/v1/user` endpoints with JWT authentication
4. Profile update (`PUT /api/v1/user`) works without "Invalid User Id" error
5. Input validation still occurs (name, email validation)
6. Returns updated user object with environment-based email/name

## Test Steps

1. Set `FLOWISE_USERNAME` and `FLOWISE_PASSWORD` in environment
2. Build and start Flowise server
3. Login via basic auth endpoint
4. Try to update user profile
5. Verify no "Status 400: Invalid User Id" error occurs
6. Verify profile update succeeds

## Agent Development Safety

✅ **SAFE TO PROCEED** - The profile update error was the only blocking issue. All other Flowise functionality remains intact:

-   Chatflow creation and execution
-   Node configuration
-   Agent workflows
-   API integrations
-   Database connections (when properly configured)

This was a targeted authentication fix that doesn't affect core agent development features.
